# Nigiri
#### the niri settings graphical interface

Nigiri is planned to be a graphical interface for niri written in typescript using astal, adw and gtk4.

as this is my first project using these libraries, you can expect progress to move at a snail's pace.

at present, the project is unable to actually manage anyone's settings whatsoever, as I'm mostly just getting the overall visual elements set up at this stage.

Per recommendations from yalter himself, my goal is to avoid directly mapping an interface to the kdl file for the sake of forwards compatibility.
